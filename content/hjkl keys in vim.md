Have you ever wondered why vim (vi) uses `hjkl` for moving the cursor?

[Bill Joy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy) created the vi text editor when he used the [ADM-3A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A) terminal, which had the arrows on `hjkl` keys.

It is also believed that UNIX convention for using tilde (`~`) for "home" folder also comes from this keyboard.
